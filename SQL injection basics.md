# SQL injection basics
`SQL injection` is probably my favourite web vulnerability, maybe after `PHP object injection`, but that's a complete another article.

So, before we dive into the famous `SQL injection` (aka *SQLi*) we need to know what is SQL, right? of course.

```
SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data where there are relations between different entities/variables of the data.
